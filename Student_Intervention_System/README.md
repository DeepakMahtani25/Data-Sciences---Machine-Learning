# Project : STUDENT INTERVENTION SYSTEM 

## Project Details: 

#### The Dataset
This project's dataset file is student-data.csv and can be accessed in this project's folder.

#### Project Summary 
A local school district has a goal to reach a 95% graduation rate by the end of the decade by identifying students who need intervention before they drop out of school. As a software engineer contacted by the school district, my task is to model the factors that predict how likely a student is to pass their high school final exam, by constructing an intervention system that leverages supervised learning techniques. The board of supervisors has asked that I find the most effective model that uses the least amount of computation costs to save on the budget. I will need to analyze the dataset on students' performance and develop a model that will predict the likelihood that a given student will pass, quantifying whether an intervention is necessary.
