# PROJECT : CREATING CUSTOMER SEGMENTS 

## Project Details: 


#### The Dataset 
The dataset for this project can be found on the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wholesale+customers). 

#### Project Summary 
In this project I  will apply unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. I will first explore the data by selecting a small subset to sample and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, I will preprocess the data by scaling each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. With the good, clean customer spending data, I will apply PCA transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I will compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
