# PROJECT : TRAIN A SMART CAB TO DRIVE 

## Project Summary: 

In this project I will apply Reinforcement learning techniques for a self-driving agent in a simplified world to aid it in effectively reaching its destinations in the allotted time. I will first investigate the environment the agent operates in by constructing a very basic driving implementation. Once the agent is successful at operating within the environment, I  will then identify each possible state the agent can be in when considering such things as traffic lights and oncoming traffic at each intersection. With states identified, I  will then implement a Q-Learning algorithm for the self-driving agent to guide the agent towards its destination within the allotted time. Finally, I will improve upon the Q-Learning algorithm to find the best configuration of learning and exploration factors to ensure the self-driving agent is reaching its destinations with consistently positive results.
