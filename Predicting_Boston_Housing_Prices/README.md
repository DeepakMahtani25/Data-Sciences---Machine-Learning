# PROJECT: PREDICTING BOSTON HOUSING PRICES

## Project Details: 

#### The Dataset 
The Boston housing dataset is not within the project folder but can be accessed and downloaded here [Boston Housing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing)
#### Project Summary 
In this project, I will apply basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area to predict the selling price of a new home. I will first explore the data to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, I will properly split the data into testing and training subsets, and determine a suitable performance metric for this problem. I will then analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes. This will enable me to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. Finally, I will test this optimal model on a new sample and compare the predicted selling price to my statistics.
