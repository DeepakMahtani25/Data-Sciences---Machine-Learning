# PROJECT: DETERMINING CONFUSION LEVELS AFTER AN EEG TEST

## Project Summary: 


#### The Dataset:
This Project’s dataset was taken from Kaggle’s website.The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/wanghaohan/eeg-brain-wave-for-confusion)Sometimes dataset versions may be updated, however my project focuses on version 1 of the dataset which can be found within the folder of this project. 

The objective of this project is to determine whether a person is expected to be confused or is actually confused after an Electroencephalogram(EEG) Test.  Also, to determine the factors that cause a person to actually be confused or expected to be confused. 
This is a Supervised Learning Problem. The Supervised learning algorithms used for this project were Classification based, such as Cross Validation, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Ks Nearest Neighbors and Gaussian Naive Bayes. 
The techniques used to derive metrics were: F1 Score and Cross Validation Score
